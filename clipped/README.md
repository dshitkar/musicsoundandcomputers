**By Dan Shitkar (PSU/Odin ID: [930527770/dshitkar])**

## Project Overview

This project creates a sine and a clipped version of the sine wave audio file and plays the clipped wave through the computer's audio output. It explores signal generation and audio manipulation techniques using Python.

## Status

- **Completed:**
  - Generating pure sine wave audio and saving it to a WAV file (`sine.wav`).
  - Generating clipped sine wave audio and saving it to a WAV file (`clipped.wav`).
  - Playing the clipped sine wave through the audio output.
